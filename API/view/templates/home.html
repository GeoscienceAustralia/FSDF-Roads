    <p> The Foundation Database is being hosted by Geoscience Australia, an Australian Government Agency. As an API
    (application programming interface) this tool allows users to access the data in both human and machine readable forms. </p>
    <p>As human readable data, roads are presented on descriptive web pages which include a map and hyperlinks to the data suppliers, the ontology, vocabularies and metadata.</p>
        <p>As machine readable data it will be available for data integration and sharing, including combination with other datasets. </p>


    <p>Users can download datasets from https://link.fsdf.org.au/fsdf-dataset/roads/</p>

    <p>Technical feedback on this Register on Roads is most welcome,
            and users are encouraged to contact us using "Contact us" link below.</p>
